# Bonus Part - Gitlab Integration

This bonus part integrates a self-hosted Gitlab instance with the Argo CD setup from the mandatory parts of the project.

## Structure

The bonus part is divided into two main folders:

1. `gitlab/`: Contains the Kubernetes manifests to set up the Gitlab instance.
2. `argocd-integration/`: Contains the configuration to integrate the Gitlab repository with Argo CD.

## Instructions

1. Follow the instructions in the `gitlab/` folder to set up the Gitlab instance.
2. Once Gitlab is running, proceed with the instructions in the `argocd-integration/` folder to integrate Gitlab with Argo CD.
3. Verify that the Argo CD application can successfully deploy the application using the Gitlab repository.

Make sure to have completed the mandatory parts of the project before attempting the bonus part.
